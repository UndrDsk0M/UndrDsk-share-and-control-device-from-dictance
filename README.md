Hello guys,

it is very simple app to use with simple ui
imagin we have two windows computer's at two diffrent place ( C1(first computer) and C2 )

C1 is us and C2 is our grandma(Its not possible for me(RIP))
our grandma cannot found her old pictures she needs some help, 
but how can we help her? with UndrDsk!

UndrDsk helps you control mouse and keyboard 
and see other share screen with less problems and cost!

this project has two side, application and server
application has two parts, Client and Controller
Client enter the joincode(controller will create it) and after that will redirect to a little page, that takes many screenshot
and convert them to bytes and send post them to server api, and gets the controller from server 

and what controller do ? he see client screen and type with keyboard in input and send it(it will go to server and redirect to client 
and can control mouse too
